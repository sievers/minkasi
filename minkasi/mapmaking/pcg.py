    """
    Function which runs preconditioned conjugate gradient on a bundle of tods to generate a map.
    PCG iteratively approximates the solution to the linear equation Ax = b,
    where A is a matrix and x and b are vectors.

    In the ML map making equation,  A = P'N"P and b = P'N"d.
    Where d the vector of TODs, N the noise matrix,  P the tod to map pointing matrix
    (i.e. a matrix that specifies which pixel in the map was observed by each TOD data point).
    In this case x is the map we are solving for.

    In the presence of a prior the least squares equation becomes:
    chi^2 = (d-Am)^T N^-1 (d-Ax) + (p-x)^T Q^-1 (p-x).
    Where p is the prior target for parameters, and Q is the variance.
    So now the equation we want to solve is:
    (A^T N-1 A + Q^-1)x = A^T N^-1 d + Q^-1 p.
    For non-zero p, it is assumed you have done this already and that:
    b=A^T N^-1 d + Q^-1 p.
    So to have a prior apply a Q^-1 x to Ax every time we call Ax.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : Mapset
        The rhs of the equation. In our case this is P'N''d.
        The TOD class has a built in method for computing this.
    x0 : Mapset
        The initial guess. Generally set to zero for the first iteration
        and then to the output of the previous itteration for subsequent iterations.
    tods : TodVec
        The input TODs we want to make into maps.
        Note the noise should already been estimated and stored within each TOD object.
    prior : HasPrior | None, default: None
        Prior on the solution to the linear equation.
        If not None then needs to implement the apply_prior method.
    precon : Mapset | None, default: None
        The preconditioner matrix applied to A to ensure faster convergence.
        1/hitsmap is a frequent selection.
        Set to None to not use.
    maxiter : int, default: 25
        Maximum number of iterations to perform.
    outroot : str, default: 'map'
        Root at which to save maps.
        Each saved iter will be saved at: outroot_{iter}{save_tail}
    save_iters : list, default: [-1]
        The iterations at which to save the result map.
        Default is to save only the last.
    save_ind : int, default: 0
        Index of Map in the MapSet x that should be saved.
    save_tail : str, default: '.fits'
        Extention for saving the output maps.
    plot_iters : list, default: []
        Which iterations to plot.
    plot_info : dict | None, default: None
        Plotting settings.
        See maps.SkyMap.plot for details.
    plot_ind : int, default: 0
        Index of Map in the MapSet x that should be plotted.

    Outputs:
        x: best guess for x after the conversion criteria has been reached (either max iter or
        Ax = b close enough to 0
